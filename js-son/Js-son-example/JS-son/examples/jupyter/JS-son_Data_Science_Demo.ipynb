    "# *JS-son* - Data Science Demo\n",
    "This Jupyer notebook provides an example of how *[JS-son](https://github.com/TimKam/JS-son)* can be integrated with state-of-the-art *data science* tools: Jupyter notebooks and Python-based analytics libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement a simple information spread simulation, using JS-son's full belief-desire-intention-plan approach and use Python tools to conduct an explorative data analysis of how changes in parameters affect the simulation results. The simulation is based on one of the tutorials we provide in the [*JS-son* README](https://github.com/TimKam/JS-son#belief-desire-intention-plan-approach).\n",
    "In this notebook, we simulate the spread of a single boolean belief among 100 agents in environments with different biases regarding the facilitation of the different opinion values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Belief spread is simulated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The scenario starts with each agent announcing their beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In each iteration, the environment distributes two belief announcements to each agent. Based on these beliefs and possibly (depending on the agent type) the past announcements the agent was exposed to, each agent *announces* a new belief: either ``true`` or ``false``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents are of two different agent types (``volatile`` and ``introspective``):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type ``volatile``: Volatile agents only consider their current belief and the latest belief set they received from the environment when deciding which belief to announce. Volatile agents are \"louder\", i.e. the environment is more likely to spread beliefs of volatile agents. We also add bias to the announcement spread function to favor ``true`` announcements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Type ``introspective``: In contrast to volatile agents, introspective agents consider the past five belief sets they have received, when deciding which belief they should announce. Introspective agents are \"less loud\", i.e. the environment is less likely to spread beliefs of volatile agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent type distribution is 50, 50.\n",
    "However, 30 volatile and 20 introspective agents start with ``true`` as their belief, whereas 20 volatile and 30 introspective agents start with ``false`` as\n",
    "their belief.\n"
